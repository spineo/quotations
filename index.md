# About Quotations

This project involves developing a simple Web Application that displays quotations based on context such as date, event, or degree of relevance. An example context would be to display a quotation by a famous historical personality on his/her birthday. Another one, to display a quotation relevant to a current event. A last one, where date or event relevance is not available, have the relevance be based on keywords association.

Quotations are often a powerful way to convey meaning, inspiration, and emotion in just a few words. The effect can be even more powerful when the quotation is associated with a specific context. From a development standpoint, a tool can be easily created to uncover these associations. In addition, since quotations and information about the authors who inspired those quotations is readily available online, much of the data can be easily mined using Web automation tools.


## Components

This project is still evolving but my initial specification will include the following components:

* More detailed description of the targetted functionality including use cases.
* Listing of the data elements that will be required for this application.
* Schema (i.e., ER diagram) that captures the data elements and their relations (to be stored in a relational database).
* A set of Web automation tools written in Perl to mine much of the data and dump it to text files (since not all quotations are created equal, I will pare down the initial dump)
* A Web Framework (I have picked Django/Python for its simplicity and versatility). Through this framework we will also specify the design of the back-end database schema and go into more implementation details (including client-side scripting)
* A set of database loader scripts that takes as input the text file(s) generated by the Web automation tools.

## Description

As mentioned, in the interest of making this a _simple_ Web Application, below are my initial use cases:

1. The home page by default displays the most relevant quote associated with the current date along with a brief bio about the author (if no date-specific relevance is found, an association derived from keyword relevance is made). This is our _detail_ view. An example date-relevant quotation and bio might be the one below if the current date is October 2nd:

> "The future depends on what we do in the present." - Mahatma Gandhi
>
> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, born on this day 1869, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political
> ethicist, who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British Rule, 
> and in turn inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world (source: extract from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi))

2. Refreshing the home page displays the next-most relevant quote (or, if none available, one based on keyword relevance). Still on _detail_ view, an example keyword-relevant quotation using the current month might be the one below if a specific-date context is not available:

> "As full of spirit as the month of May, and as gorgeous as the sun in Midsummer" - William Shakespeare
>
> William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as 
> the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet 
> and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 
> sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated 
> into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright (source: extract from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare))

3. A search field allows a user to enter a search term and return a list (ordered by relevance) of quotations associated with that term. The number returned can be specified from a selection widget (i.e., in increments of 5 or 10). This is our _list_ view that shows only the quotation and author associated with each returned item along with a link to the _detail_ view (that includes the author bio as showbn above)

That's it for use cases (at least for now)

## Data Elements and Schema

1. The Starting point is cataloging a series of _Events_ and their associated _Dates_ and/or _Seasons_ (from the event _Author_ and/or _Keywords_ relations we will find the most relevant quotation(s))
2. The _Quotations_ and _Authors_ (as well as any _Source_ associated with each quotation) are of course stored. As we discussed, an author has certain attributes associated with him/her such as _Birth/Death Date_ and _Bio_ information. The quotation might also have one or more _Keywords_ associated with it which can tie it to events or user initiated queries.
3. Finally, we want to keep track of when the quotation was last shown and thus prevent it from being re-displayed when user refreshes the browser (unless it is included in the returned list of a user initiated search)

Our first draft of the schema or _Entity-Relation Diagram (ERD)_ might look like the one below:

![Quotations ERD](images/quotations_erd.png)

In a real query we may get zero or more events associated with a date (in the case of zero, we might pull in event(s) by associating month or season to today's date). With multiple events, we might give precedence to those events tied to an author as oppposed to just a keyword (though even a single author might have multiple quotations so we would need to decide which one to display)

In the ideal world, a tie breaker might best be broken by pulling in some currently _trending topics_ (perhaps something for version 2.0 of this app!)

## Web Automation Tools

### Get the Quotes

The purpose of these tools is to pull raw data when possible. Much of the data "cleanup" will be done manually. This will include deciding which quotations and events to include as well as which keywords to associate.

I have created, as generic as possible, a Web automation [script](https://github.com/spineo/perl-scripts/blob/master/bin/get_quotes.pl) located in my [perl-scripts](https://github.com/spineo/perl-scripts/) GitHub repository to pull a few thousand _quotations/authors_ from one or more sites as well as an optional _source_ (for this site, usually a book reference) and _tags_ (corresponding to "keywords" in the ERD). A short extract from the raw data generated is shown below:

```
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching###William W. Purkey######dance,heaven,hurt,inspirational,life,love,sing
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.###Dr. Seuss######attributed-no-source,dreams,love,reality,sleep
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.###Elbert Hubbard######friend,friendship,knowledge,love
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.###Martin Luther King Jr.###A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches###darkness,drive-out,hate,inspirational,light,love,peace
We accept the love we think we deserve.###Stephen Chbosky###The Perks of Being a Wallflower###inspirational,love
```

The script is run with the required command-line option '--config' which points to a site specific configuration file. An example site [template](https://github.com/spineo/perl-scripts/blob/master/conf/get_quotes.site.template) is checked into the _conf_ directory of the _perl-scripts_ repository. For any sites I visit, at least for now, will not plan on using any available feeds (i.e., RSS) to extract data.

Note: Make sure that extraction of content does not infringe on copyrights (especially if used for commercial purposes)

### Filtering the Quotes

Since the script can potentially retrieve tens of thousands of quotes (of which well over 99% are of no value to me) I decided to perform an intial filtering by author. For this manual exercise I arbitrarily came up with 100 authors spanning multiple nationalities and occupations. The criteria for picking these authors was that they are (or were) masters in their endevours or occupations, worthy of my admiration, and that they had at least two quotations that were inspiring or thought provoking. As I produced this list, I also included the additional fields country of origin, occupation, birth date, death date (if deceased), and optionally a link to a bio. The [_filter_quotes.pl_](https://github.com/spineo/perl-scripts/blob/master/bin/filter_quotes.pl) script then creates an intermediate data structure (sample shown below) keyed by the lowercased/dash-separated/stripped full name and applies it to the quotes file:
```

                           'lname_sig' => 'twain',

                           'birth_date' => 'February 24, 1955',
                           'title' => 'Businessman'
                         },

                                },
```

Pretty printed output for one author is shown below. A command-line option allows applying a filter by quote size (for this run any quote over 100 characters got tossed). Clearly a language filter (or translator) might also be useful!

                                 'bio_url' => 'https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/biography/albert-einstein-biography'
                               },
```

Alternatively, the filtering script can output the author tags and then have the quote extraction script apply these directly when searching the site(s) (instead of returning and then filtering a broader search keyed by topic)

## Web Framework

As mentioned, the Web Framework used with be [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) which is implemented with Python.
